# ass1-Basic ros and opencv 

## assigment descriptions


Write 4 nodes:
1.  The first node will use OpenCV to read the image "colors.jpg" and publish it on a topic. 
2.  The second node will be used to read a color from the input, and publish it on a topic. 
3.  The third node will subscribe to both topics, receive the image and the color, find the coordinates for the center of the circle with this color and itâ€™s radius. The coordinates will be advertised on a new topic.
4.  The last node will receive the coordinates and radius, recieve the image from the first topic, draw a circle around the circle of the selected color and save the new image to a file. 

## how to run this assigment
* $ roscore
* $ rosrun assigment1 color_node r g b
* $ rosrun assigment1 image_node 
* $ rosrun assigment1 find_circle 
* $ rosrun assigment1 draw

### eaxmple rgbs inputs to give to *color_node* 
- red    = 255,0,0
- blue   = 0,0,255
- green  = 0,255,0
- yellow = 255,255,0
